	// Version 1.0   - Turned C files into just a single CPP file
	//               - Made them compile cleanly as C++ files
	//               - Gave them simpler APIs
	//               - Added the ability to zip/unzip directly in memory without 
	//                 any intermediate files

* gettext 0.22.4 

	The source files wrapped the interface of gettext in our program has been located on the Github.
	See https://github.com/aceview-cc/AceView for details.

	The gettext-runtime package is partially under the LGPL and partially under
	the GPL.
	
	The following parts are under the LGPL, see file intl/COPYING.LIB:
	- the libintl and libasprintf libraries and their header files,
	- the libintl.jar Java library,
	- the GNU.Gettext.dll C# library,
	- the gettext.sh shells script function library.
	
	The following parts are under the GPL, see file COPYING in the toplevel
	directory:
	- the _programs_ gettext, ngettext, envsubst,
	- the documentation.

	The GNU gettext package is the first full featured package
	directed to NLS support in the GNU packages.  It has its roots in the
	GNU C Library development and of course the (never officially
	released) GNU locale package, mostly written by Jim Meyering.
	Therefore a lot of people participated in the process of creating this
	software.
	
	Written in April-June 1995 by
	Ulrich Drepper          drepper@ipd.info.uni-karlsruhe.de
	
	Special thanks to François Pinard <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>, who did a
	major part of the testing, provided the Emacs PO mode, and wrote major
	parts of the manual.
	
	Peter Miller <millerp@canb.auug.org.au> invested a lot of his time in making
	gettext usable in other GNU projects and wrote the msgmerge, msgcmp, and
	msgunfmt programs.
	
	Guido Flohr <guido@imperia.net> wrote the Perl backend of xgettext and
	the libintl-perl package.
	
	Gora Mohanty <gora_mohanty@yahoo.co.in> wrote the tutorial.
	
	Thanks to all of the following for their valuable
	hints/fixes/discussions/contributions.
